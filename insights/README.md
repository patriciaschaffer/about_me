### Overview

This section gathers essays, manifestos, and reflections that inform my understanding and approach to artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. These writings explore the ethical, psychological, and cultural dimensions of AI development and deployment.

They represent ongoing thinking about how AI systems can and should respect human agency, transparency, and shared responsibility between users and technology.

These insights serve to:

- Document foundational beliefs guiding my work and collaborations.
- Provide conceptual frameworks for ethical AI design.
- Invite reflection on the human-AI relationship, responsibility, and projection.
- Articulate principles that underpin trustworthy and respectful AI interfaces.

Each piece is positioned as a conversation starter rather than prescriptive policy. They offer a lens through which to critically examine AI technologies and their societal impacts.

Please note that the tone and complexity of these writings vary. Some are philosophical and conceptual, others practical and policy-oriented. They reflect a commitment to clarity, honesty, and ethical rigor.
