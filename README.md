### About Me

I’m an early adopter of computers and the internet, always curious about the intersections of technology and human behavior. My journey spans education, psychology, and cutting-edge AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs). I believe that understanding natural languages is key to building technology that truly serves people. I thought I'd come to GitHub because LLMs need more than computer science, and we should all join the conversation and build together.

### My Approach

I work deliberately with models designed for the end user—not AGI. Most people will experience AI through practical, designed interfaces, not theoretical intelligence. This is the true entry point for trust, adoption, and real-world impact, and it’s also where future clients and collaborations will emerge. My work shapes these agents for consistency, alignment, and tangible value in the hands of those who use them.
