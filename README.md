## 🌟 About Me

I’m an early adopter of computers and the internet, always curious about the intersections of technology and human behavior. My journey spans education, psychology, and cutting-edge AI—especially Large Language Models (LLMs). I believe that understanding natural languages is key to building technology that truly serves people. I thought I'd come to GitHub because LLMs need more than computer science, and we should all join the conversation and build together.
