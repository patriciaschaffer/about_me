## Part 3: Rhetorical Symmetry Observations

| Topic | Temperature | Symmetry Assessment                                                                                 |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | 0.7         | Balanced use of arguments; pro emphasizes systemic remedies; critical focuses on meritocracy and stigma. Tone mostly calm, measured. |
| 1     | 1.0         | Stronger language on both sides; pro emphasizes social justice forcefully; critical highlights mismatch and reverse discrimination more sharply. |
| 2     | 0.7         | Pro side stresses respect and inclusion; critical side focuses on tradition and complexity concerns. Both show some concession via softening language. |
| 2     | 1.0         | More explicit ideological framing: pro uses terms like "equity," critical invokes "political correctness" and "policing." Slightly less neutral tone. |
| 3     | 0.7         | Pro favors regulation with moderate tone, emphasizing harm prevention; critical argues for free speech as democratic foundation, cautious about censorship. |
| 3     | 1.0         | Arguments more detailed and expansive; pro stresses international law and social cohesion; critical underlines marketplace of ideas and censorship abuse risks. |

## Part 4: README-Style Narrative Summary

### Overview

This analysis examined paired GPT-generated responses on three socio-political topics: Affirmative Action, Inclusive Language, and Freedom of Speech. Each topic was presented in pro and critical stances, at two different temperature settings (0.7 and 1.0), to capture variations in style and intensity.

### Sentiment and Subjectivity

Pro responses generally exhibit positive sentiment with moderate to high subjectivity, reflecting an assertive endorsement of inclusive policies or protections. Critical responses tend toward neutral or slightly negative sentiment with similar or higher subjectivity, emphasizing concerns or drawbacks. Higher temperature responses increase subjectivity and stance intensification across the board.

### Language Features

Pro arguments use more stance-intensifying language (e.g., “must,” “essential”) reflecting commitment and urgency, while critical responses employ more softening terms (e.g., “might,” “sometimes”), indicating caution or nuance. Trigger words differ subtly, with pro texts emphasizing “equity,” “systemic,” and “dignity,” while critiques foreground “meritocracy,” “political correctness,” and “censorship.”

### Lexical Diversity

Lexical diversity is stable across temperature and stance, indicating a consistent vocabulary breadth. Pro texts slightly favor positive lexical tones, while critical texts show balanced positive/negative valence, underscoring their role in challenging positions.

### Rhetorical Symmetry

Both sides maintain rhetorical symmetry: pro texts focus on social justice, inclusion, and prevention of harm; critical texts stress merit, tradition, individual agency, and risks of overreach. The tone remains respectful and measured, suitable for balanced discourse.

### Implications for Further Research

This dataset provides a controlled corpus for sentiment, stance, and linguistic feature analysis across socially charged topics. Future analyses could explore interaction effects between temperature, stance, and complexity or deploy more granular lexical-semantic frameworks.
